# Run and Debug your React Native application
This extension supports generating debugging configuration in the `.vscode/launch.json` file by selecting debugging parameters in dropdown lists at the top of the editor.

The extension also allows to start debugging without creating the `launch.json` file in one of the following ways:
- Using dynamic debugging configurations
