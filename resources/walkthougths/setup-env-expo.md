# Expo applications
Prepare your environment by following the [Expo CLI Quickstart instruction](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).
Also pay attention to the `React Native CLI Quickstart` tab, where you can find other requirements. Also you need to:
- Install the [Expo app](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/#2-expo-go-app-for-ios-and) on the target device or emulator
- Have a working [React Native environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).
- Ensure that the `expo-cli` is installed globally (`npm install -g expo-cli`)
- Ensure that the `@expo/ngrok` is installed globally (`npm install -g @expo/ngrok`) in case you need to use `tonnel` Expo host

You can verify that everything is working correctly and that the environment is ready for use with the `npx react-native doctor` command.
